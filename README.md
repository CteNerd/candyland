# Roddy's CandyLand Game

This project was created to mimic Hasbro's CandyLand game for the purpose of demonstrating technical skills. Please note that this application is not intended to replace the actual game. It only includes the card drawing functionality and does not involve moving pieces across a game board.

## Build Status

## How to Play

1. **Add Players**: Start by adding players. You can add up to a maximum of 4 players.
2. **Start Game**: Once all players are added, hit the "Start Game" button.
3. **Draw Cards**: Players will take turns in order to draw cards. The current player's name will be displayed on the draw button, so if you leave and forget whose turn it is, no worries, the name is on the button. ðŸ˜Š


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below to download the repository to your local system and run the application.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local system using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/candyland-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd candyland-game
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
